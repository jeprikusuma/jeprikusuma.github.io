            <h1>Pendet : Welcoming Dance From Bali</h1>
            <div class="parag">
              <p>
                Dance has always been a part of many sacred ceremonies and
                traditional rituals in the island. Some dances are considered
                sacred as they are offered to the Gods or the deities, while
                others are simply performed for the audience. Pendet dance is a
                simple welcoming dance choreographed to welcome the audience.
                The dance is one of many dances that are often performed not
                only during a sacred ceremony at the temple, but also at a
                commercial stage to entertain the audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pendet, choreographed by I Wayan Rindi, presents a graceful way
                of welcoming people. The dance begins with a group of dancers,
                female dancers, slowly entering the stage, each of them holding
                a bowl of flowers, just like the Hindu Balinese style of
                offering. They then make a vajrasana pose- sitting on their
                heels with their calves beneath their thighs, their hands moving
                as if they ar­e praying. This pose is related to a Hindu belief,
                which is to always start any activity with a prayer. Several
                Balinese dances have been modified, with the basic routines
                being performed in a dynamic way. The gamelan, Bali’s
                traditional orchestra, leads the dancers with their vibrant
                musical arrangement. The bright colours and elaborate costumes
                help entertain the eyes during the routines. Hairpieces made of
                golden flowers adorn the dancers’ neatly arranged hair.
                Sometimes fresh flowers are also added to enhance the ensemble.
                Brightly coloured eyeshadows and red lipstick make their faces
                stunning under the lights. Several colours of Kain Prada- Bali’s
                authentic gold print fabric, is wrapped tightly from chest to
                hip covering the top of their slender body creating gorgeous
                layers of colour. From hip to ankle, another layer of flowy
                fabric is attached.
              </p>
              <p>
                The smiles never disappear from the dancers’ faces during the
                performance. Their bodies move in elegance from one routine to
                another. Their eyes also play an important role in this dance
                just like the other dances of Bali. The eye movements are sharp
                and show strong emotion. It is amazing to see how their eyeballs
                quickly shift from the upper left corner to the lower right
                corner and vice versa. A long period of practising has
                definitely perfected their performance. Towards the end of the
                Pendet Dance, one significant routine is performed. It is when
                the dancers pick a handful of petals from the bowl and toss it
                in the air as if showering the audience with the petals.
                Watching these performances during your stay in Bali will give
                you a taste of the artistic side of the Balinese and let you
                witness the traditional art performances that have been
                preserved for many generations. One may notice that the young
                generation in Bali are now preoccupied with modern technology
                and social media, but they are still interested in learning how
                to perform the traditional dances of their homeland and even to
                create some new choreography.

                spices. In general, lawar-based traditional Balinese spices
                contained turmeric, shrimp paste, salt and pepper, galangal and
                roots, grated coconut, green beans, boiled young jackfruit and
                sometimes, cassava and star fruit leaves which are all chopped
                and mixed together. There are different types based on its
                ingredients. They are named after the main meat or ingredients
                that is added into the mixture These are some visual photos and
                description of lawar to differentiate one to another.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lawar Barak It is red in colour and made of chopped meat,
                vegetables, spices, coconut and most importantly, to distinct
                the flavour, the blood of the meat itself is added which could
                come from chicken or pig’s blood. This dish usually does not
                last all day if expose to open air, so it is better to consume
                it immediately. Lawar Putih This is the most presented lawar you
                can find in ceremonies of Bali. The ingredients contain grated
                coconut which is combined together with other type of lawar that
                may include meat and vegetables. Vegetable Lawar To custom to
                the taste of vegetarian out there, you can find lawar that is
                usually cooked with chopped long beans and young jackfruits
                which is normally referred as Lawar Nangka (jackfruit).
                Variations of flavour such as mangos, papaya and melons are also
                out in the market. Pork Lawar The most popular lawar you could
                find in Bali is Lawar Babi which from the name it self, made
                from cooked and chopped pork. You could also find it in other
                meat such as duck and turtle, although nowadays is quite hard to
                find and is priced at a higher price of IDR100.000.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are more various type of lawar out there. Each of Bali’s
                provinces offer different ways and prepartion for their lawar.

                tongue of their customers which price ranges from IDR15.000 to
                IDR20.000. You may request it to be spicy or not, but spicy
                lawar will actually help enhance all the flavour. This dish is
                usually served with rice and other dishes and is often found
                during religious ceremonies to family events. Prior to the
                ceremony, people usually gather to make them together.

            <h1>Pandawa : The Most Popular Beach in Bali</h1>
            <div class="parag">
              <p>
                Bali Pandawa Beach is located in Kutuh Village, South Kuta
                District, Badung Regency; around 3 km from the famous Nusa Dua
                area and Uluwatu Temple. In the past, this beach was hidden
                behind hill so it was called Secret Beach. Secret Beach actually
                had known well by some tourists. However, the difficult access
                to this location made this beach was empty. The visitors of this
                beach were only a few foreign surfers or domestic tourists.
                Fortunately, the local government of Badung Regency realized the
                potential of this beach and quickly managed this beach then
                launched it as a new mainstay attraction. The result can now be
                felt such as a better access heading to the beach which is now
                become more convenient for any vehicles. Pandawa Beach has a
                stunning panorama with serene and quiet atmosphere. When
                entering the beach area, we will be amazed by beautiful panorama
                of high cliff, flanking the road along 1.5 km. The road is
                purposively built through limestone hills in Kutuh Village,
                similar with the hills in GWK.
              </p>
              <p>
                Formerly, Pandawa Beach is a hidden and secret beach that was
                very difficult to access due to located in the deep valley and
                surrounded by the white stone cliff. We must go through a small
                step down on the cliff with dangerous valley underneath and the
                only local people can access the beach since they were own daily
                job as fishermen and seaweed farmer. But today, the old story
                was changed. Since local people have the great inspiration to
                build their village, they work together to break the cliff and
                make the good road and can be accessed by any vehicles. Since
                the access is created, many visitors from foreign country either
                domestic visit this beach every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we pass through the new access to Pandawa Beach, we will be
                provided a complimentary amazing view of white sandy beach with
                Indian Ocean just in front of it. On the way down to the beach,
                we will discover several caves with beautiful ornament of white
                stone statue taking the inspiration of Panca Pandawa(5 big
                brothers from Mahabaratha epoch). The statues are beautiful
                craved with Balinese ornaments and to be one of spot for photo
                taking when visiting this sight.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Pandawa Beach's name is taken from the name of 5 big
                brothers at Mahabaratha epoch consisted of Yudistira, Bima,
                Arjuna, Sahadewa and Nakula. This story had inspired the
                Balinese Hindu social life those are reflecting their cultures.
                There are many places, buildings, people's name, street's name
                and plenty firm of items in particular statues, puppets and much
                more taking from this story and Pandawa Beach is one of them.

            <h1>Agung : The Biggest Mountain in Bali</h1>
            <div class="parag">
              <p>
                Standing majestically on the eastern seaboard of Bali is the
                island’s highest mountain: Gunung Agung or Mount Agung, located
                in the district of Karangasem. With its summit reaching a height
                of 3,031 meters above sea level, Mt. Agung affects its
                surrounding climate. Its western slopes catch the rain clouds
                making the west side lush and fertile, while its eastern slopes
                remain dry and barren.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Balinese believe that Mt. Agung is the abode of the gods,
                and the volcano, therefore, is revered as sacred. It is on this
                mountain that the mother of all temples in Bali is located,
                called Pura Besakih. Entering the temple one has to climb
                hundreds of steps before reaching the main gate. But,
                fortunately, other staircases with easier climbs are available
                to make it easier for women carrying high mountains of offerings
                on their heads to reach the temple. The best time to visit
                Besakih is at Galungan celebrations when the entire entrance and
                temple is beautifully decorated with tall bamboo poles, coconut
                leaves, and flowers, while hundreds of women in a neat row, in
                their best white costume, gracefully bear piles of colorful
                fruits and flowers offerings on their head. While commanding
                protectively in the background of the temple looms Mt. Agung.
                This is indeed a spectacle never to be forgotten.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although Mt. Agung inspires peace and tranquility, nonetheless,
                after 100 years of slumber, on 17 March 1963 the volcano burst
                violently, spewing ash and volcanic materials 8 to 10 km high
                into the air while pyroclastic clouds rolled down all sides of
                the mountain. Over a thousand people perished that day. And the
                entire surrounding down to Kintamani was blanketed for months in
                deep grey ash. But surprisingly, the ash brought fertility and
                large sweet potatoes grew from the volcanic material.
